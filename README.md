# Sunbae-Beta-1.0
HackJam - the learning hacakthon
This is a project that we (Zeph, Abdull, and Jo) made during the Hack Jam. 
It was our first time to build a website with our limited HTML/CSS and Python
knowledge. It was a lot of fun. Below is a description for this repository.

Purpose: Sunbae is a web community where students can share their opinion about courses that they've already taken before.
The problem that we were trying to solve was as a student myself, I'd like to hear real course review from real students.
But mostly I just relied on my friends who've already taken the courses which don't really help me out.
